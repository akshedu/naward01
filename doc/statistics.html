           The dataset we have extracted from the MAIN dataset has a size of 202026911608 bytes or 202GB. The number of “unique” domains crawled is 249965073, however this count does not make a difference between subdomains or top-level or second-level domains. For example “x.blogspot.nl”, “x1.blogspot.nl” are counted as 2. According to http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/08/internet-passes-250m-registered-top-level-domain-names/
           , the total number of domains registered hit 252m in April 2013. Quantity wise, it is close to the real number of registered domains, however we do not know what the real number of domains of the CommonCrawl dataset is.
