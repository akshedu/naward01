            &ldquo;
            A web archive such as archive.org would be more suitable for such things. However the data is not open to the public, apart from researchers, scholars etc. This notion makes a difference, but we'll get back to this later. To construct a timeline, it's possible to only use the CommonCrawl snapshots of the web, as they are timestamped. Currently there are snapshots of ~2008 - 2014 available; the granularity is a bit coarse. On the NorvigAward website we can see that the only the 2014 set is available. We can augment the 2014 data using the JSON-API of the Wayback machine on archive.org. As for the security analysis we can use data from http://www.cvedetails.com/. Depending on the time allocated for this lab relative to the entire course we can decide which type of security to focus on.
